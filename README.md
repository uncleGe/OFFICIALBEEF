# OfficialBeef
Official Beef is a playful web application where users can make any complaint "official." It was constructed on Google Cloud Platform and takes advantage of Jinja templating in addition to App Engine's GQL data manipulation. Official Beef's backend provides the user with a timely list of all officially logged beefs, as well as a custom login authentication system.
